A fundamental area in Computer Science is to develop _algorithmic_ processes for
efficiently _storing_ and _retrieving_ data structures of growing classes of
datasets with good performance. Two important building blocks in solving such
problems are _Sorting_ and _Searching_ algorithms. From the previous lectures,
several classes of data structures were introduced such as lists, trees and
graphs that maps a given data set into a specific organization and structure of
that data. On a functional-level, the data is the same but _working_ with the
data structure such as performing an _insert_ or _finding an element_ comes with
it's trade-offs to performance.

The goal of this assignment is to separate the internals of a data structure
from its operations (e.g search, insert, deletion) to understand how the overall
performance varies between three dimensions: _classes of datasets, data
structures & algorithms_.

## Loading three different classes of data into three data structures

## Implement sorting algorithms

## Implement Search

## Performance Comparison
