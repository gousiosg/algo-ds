A fundamental area in Computer Science is to develop _algorithmic_ processes for
efficiently _storing_ and _retrieving_ data with good performance. Nowadays,
data is fast-produced leading to high volume of data in no time. It is
anticipated that _Internet of Things_ (IoT) devices will generate [400
zettabytes](https://goo.gl/xu4NcT) of data in 2018. Performing analytics or
science on such large datasets poses many problems with performance. Two
important building blocks in solving such problems are _Sorting_ and _Searching_
algorithms. From the previous lectures, several classes of data structures were
introduced such as _lists_, _trees_ and _graphs_ that maps a given dataset into
the organization of that data structure. On a functional-level, the data is the
same but _working_ with the data structure such as performing an _insert_ or
_finding an element_ comes with it's trade-offs to performance. This can be
important to consider depending on the character of the dataset and it's
application constraints.

The goal of this assignment is to separate the internals of a data structure
from its operations to understand how the overall performance varies between a
sorted and unsorted data structure. The two performance aspects that you will
investigate is the **time complexity** and **space complexity**. The data
structure you will work with is a conventional 2D list structure also known as a
*Matrix*. The concepts and performance measurements discussed in this assignment
should be applicable for other data structures such as a _graph_.

In this assignment, you will work with an open public dataset from [_Brandweer
Amsterdam-Amstelland_](https://goo.gl/tE3Ahi) that contains over **125.000**
fire alarms reported in this region. The dataset is provided in a compressed
zip-format and the resulting CSV-file will be ~124MB. While there are handy
libraries such as [_pandas_](http://pandas.pydata.org/) that can read a CSV-file
into a table, we will only restrict to using core libraries that is part of
Python. To read a CSV-file to a 2D array, we do the following:


```python
import csv #NB: don't forget to include the csv library

def load(csv_file):
  """
    Loads the data from the file in the provided argument into a 2D array
  """
  with open(csv_file) as csvDataFile:
      return [row for row in csv.reader(csvDataFile, delimiter=';')]
```
If we inspect the first element of the resulting array, we obtain information
about the structure of the dataset and this is shown below. Consecutive elements
of the array follow this format where the first element in the row is the
*incident_id* and the last element is the *gementee*
```
[['incident_id',
  'start_tijd',
  'incident_type',
  'landelijke_meldingsclassificatie_niveau1',
  'landelijke_meldingsclassificatie_niveau2',
  'landelijke_meldingsclassificatie_niveau3',
  'datum',
  'jaar',
  'maand_nr',
  'maand_naam',
  'dag_nr',
  'dag_naam',
  'week_nr',
  'kwartaal',
  'prioriteit',
  'uur',
  'dagdeel',
  'objecttype',
  'objectfunctie',
  'buurt',
  'wijk',
  'woonplaats',
  'gemeente'],
  ......
  ]
```


## Ordering the dataset
We can observe by inspecting the first 5 rows in the 2D array that the data is
_unordered_, the *incident_id* that represents the unique identification of each
fire alarm event and the creation time stamp of each event is out-of-sync.


**T (30 points):** Your first task is to implement the **insertion sort
algorithm** to sort the dataset according to the *incident_id* and the creation
date. Notice that the algorithm is slow and will not scale. Therefore only a
subset of the dataset will be used. From the function definition below, the
_table_ argument represents the 2D array, _f_ is the compare function and _limit_
describes the size of the dataset (NB: the offset is always the first element)

```python
def insertionSort(table, f, limit=150,*args, **kwargs):
  """
    Takes a data table, take a subset of 150 elements and sorts it
    NB: first value of the array is a schema of the data
  """
  subtable = table[1:limit+1]
  pass
```

The compare function _f_ that is provided in the argument list is used for
comparing two elements and is the piece of information the sort algorithm needs
to know in which order to sort elements. The _incident_id_ should be sorted as an
Integer but in the 2D array it is a String. Therefore we need to
convert to an Integer and also explain the _natural order_ of this type. The "0"
indicates _incident_id_

```python
def cmpf(rowA , rowB):
    return int(rowA[0]) > int(rowB[0])
```
Similarly, this has to be done for date comparison 

```python
def cmpfDatum(rowA , rowB):
    #import datetime
    #6 = datum
    # 2008/01/03 00:00:00.000000000, remove microsec
    return datetime.datetime.strptime(rowA[6][:-10],'%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S') >
    datetime.datetime.strptime(rowB[6][:-10],'%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S')

```

After implementing the algorithm, try out the following _limit_ values:

- limit=25
- limit=75
- limit=100
- limit=150
- limit=250

Notice that the time increases with the size of the data. An improvement to the
algorithm is to treat this problem using a *divide and conquer*-approach that
divides the dataset into sub-lists. This improvement is called the *shell
algorithm*


**T (10 points):** Your task is to modify the current implementation of the
**insertion sort** algorithm to work with *shell sort algorithm*. The modified
version should be called **gapInsertionSort** and use the arguments specified
below. You have to solve how the **startposition** and **sublistcount** is
used to make this work.


```python
def shellSort(table, f, limit, *args, **kwargs):
    subtable = table[1:limit+1]
    sublistcount = len(subtable)//2
    while sublistcount > 0:
      for startposition in range(sublistcount):
        #implement the function call below
        gapInsertionSort(subtable,f,startposition,sublistcount,*args, **kwargs)
      print("After increments of size",sublistcount,
                                   "The list is",table)

      sublistcount = sublistcount // 2

```

Try for the same *limit* sizes as in the previous task and notice the
difference, you will also observe that it will not be able process much more.

We can identify that this is not well enough, we are not able to process 124,000
records and we need to have an algorithm with a lower time complexity. There are
two other algorithms that have a "O(n log n)" time complexity but there space
complexity varies. For *merge sort*, the space complexity is O (n) which means a
linear growth of the space but for a *quick sort*, the space complexity is
constant but the performance could degrade to "O(n^2)" depending on the data and
selection of the pivot. For instance, if the dataset is ordered or the elements
are the same. This is not the case for the dataset that we are using

**T (40 points):** Your task is to implement the *quick sort algorithm*, the
stubs for the algorithm is presented here and the challenge here is choosing the
pivot such that it can in short time process all the records.

```python
def quickSort(table):
   quickSortHelper(table,0,len(alist)-1)

def quickSortHelper(table,first,last):
    pass

def partition(alist,table,last):
    pass
```

**T (30 points):** Create a benchmark that shows the data size vs time for all
these algorithms

## Searching the dataset
The final part of the assignment is to perform find elements in a data set. We
will use two search techniques, a simple linear search and binary search.

**T (30 points):** Create a linear search algorithm and your task is to find the
following: (I have to check on the dataset)

```python
def lsearch(sortedTable,f,field='incident_id',find=12345,*args, **kwargs):
    pass
```
*Hint 1:* You have to use the same compare function as in the previous tasks to
provide for *f*

*Hint 2:* The *field=...* represents the format, you can maintain an enum that
converts a name to the index number in the array

We could observe that for two of the search queries, they took considerable
time, this due to the fact that we don't know where the items are. Many
algorithms are designed with the idea that the data set is sorted. Therefore, we
will try the same on a sorted data set. 

```python

sortedTable = quickSort(table)
def lsearch(sortedTable,f,field='incident_id',find=12345,*args, **kwargs):
    pass
```

Try the same search queries, you will notice that the search executed faster.

We can further enhance the *search process* by exploiting the properties of
using a sorted array. A binary search algorithm uses the properties of a sorted
algorithm. The process is very intuitive and can be illustrated using the
*De Telefoongids* that is a sorted dataset with name and telephone numbers ordered.
If you look for someone with the surname "Hejderup", you will start at the index
H and continue the search there.

**T (30 points):** Your task is to implement a binary search version with the
same search queries as in the previous task.

```python

sortedTable = quickSort(table)
def bsearch(sortedTable,f,field='incident_id',find=12345,*args, **kwargs):
    pass
```

*Optional (Bonus task)*

**T (30 points):** Last task is to find multiple entries, your task is to modify
the binary search such that all results for the municipality of Amsterdam is
returned.
