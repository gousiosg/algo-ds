Graphs are one of the most common data structures in computer science;
graph-based modeling of problems is at the heart of many systems we use
every day, such as routing in Google Maps or recommending friends on Facebook.

[Social Network Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis)
(SNA) is a branch of sociology that explores social structures through the use
of analytical tools, such as graphs. In this assignment, you will implement
basic social network analysis algorithms on a graph extracted from GitHub.

You can find the graph data
[at this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Rx0uhucsroT1dzYjlfVU9nWUU/view?usp=sharing).
The data looks like this (CSV format):

```
follower,followed
1570,9236
9236,1570
13256,9236
9236,13256
13256,1570
1570,13256
```

If we take the first line, it means that user `1570` follows user `9236`.

## Loading the graph

**T (10 points):** Write a function that takes as input a file name and
loads the data into an adjacency list representation.

```python
def load(graph_file='github.graph'):
  """
    Loads the data from the file in the provided argument into an in-memory
    graph (as an adjacency list)
  """
  pass
```

From now on, you must use the graph returned by `load` in all the assignments
below.

## Basic graph metrics

**T (10 points):** Who are the 10 most connected users?

```python
def most_connected(graph, n = 10):
  """
    Returns the ids of the top-n most connected users
  """
  pass
```

_Hint_: it helps if you first define a method called `in_degree` that calculates
the number of incoming edges in to a node.

**T (10 points):** What is the mean and what is the median number of connections?

## Computing shortest paths

Shortest paths are the basis for many network measures. You will need to implement Dijkstra algorithm.

**T (20 points):** Write a function that computes the shortest paths
between all node pairs in the graph. 

```python
def shortest_paths(graph):
  """
  Computes the shortest paths between any pair of nodes in the graph
  
  @return A dictionary whose keys are node pairs and values are sequences
  indicating the shortest path between the node pair.
  """
  pass
```

_Hint_: Choose the appropriate shortest path algorithm for undirected graph
with no edge weights. A pair of nodes $(n_1, n_2)$ is, for our purposes,
equivalent to the pair $(n_2, n_1)$.

_Hint_: How to find all unique node pairs? Given that you create a non-duplicate
list of all your nodes, you can use Python's `itertools.combinations` function 
like so:

```{python}
from itertools import combinations
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
pairs = list(combinations(a, 2))
print pairs
```

## Ranking important users

One of the primary uses of SNA is to identify important/influencial nodes.
A typical metric we use to quantify the importance of a node is centrality.
Several [centrality measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality) 
exist; for our purposes it is enough to calculate the **Betweeness Centrality**
of each node. The pseudocode to calculate it is given below.

To compute the betweenness of a node $n$

1. For each pair of nodes $(v1, v2)$, compute the shortest paths between them
2. For each pair of nodes $(v1, v2)$ determine the fraction of shortest paths
that include $n$
3. Sum this fraction over all pairs of vertices $(v1, v2)$

**T (30 points):** Write a function that computes the Betweenness centrality for
all nodes in the provided network

```python
def betweenness(graph):
  pass
```

**T (10 points):** Use the function above to rank the nodes (users) in
terms of importance.
