## **Optimizations**

## **What is optimization?**
![](./figures/function.svg){width=45%}

- Optimization is the process of adjusting the **inputs** to or
  **characteristics** of a device, mathematical process, or experiment to find
  the minimum or maximum output.
- The input consists of variables; the process or function is known as the
  _cost/objective_ function; and the output is the _cost/fitness_.
  

## **Trial and error optimization**

refers to the process of adjusting variables that affect the output without
knowing much about the process that produces the output.

e.g., adjusting the antenna to get the best reception.

## **Dynamic vs. static optimization**
Dynamic optimization is function of time!

e.g., The fastest way to work may depend on the time of day and weather.

## **Descrete or continuous optimization**

**Discrete** variables have only a finite number of possible values, whereas
**continuous** variables have an infinite number of possible values.

e.g.: If we are deciding in what order to attack a series of tasks on a
list, discrete optimization is employed.

## **Natural optimization methods**

- Simulated Annealing
- Particle swarm optimization
- Ant colony optimization
- Evolutionary algorithms
- _Genetic Algorithm_
- etc.

## **Simulated Annealing**
Simulates the annealing process:

a substance is heated above its melting temperature and then gradually cooled to
produce the crystalline lattice, which minimizes its energy
probability distribution.
