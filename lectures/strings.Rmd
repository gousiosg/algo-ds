## What is a string?

* **In math**: A _string_ is a finite sequence of symbols that are chosen from a
set called an _alphabet_.

* **In CS**: A _string_ is a sequence of characters.

What is the alphabet for strings in CS?

## Alphabets or encodings

In computer memory, strings are nothing more that binary data.

## Typical String Encodings

* **1-byte** encodings: EBCDIC and **ASCII**
* **2-byte** encodings: CJK (for logographic languages), Shift-JIS
* **n-byte** encodings: Unicode **UTF-8**

## ASCII

ASCII was originally a 7-bit encoding.

## Fun with ASCII

ASCII characters are representable as numbers. This means that
we can do arithmetic on them. 

```c
#include<stdio.h>

main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 128; i++)
      printf("%c ", i);

    printf("%d\n", c);    

    for (int i = 128; i < 256; i++)
      printf("%c ", i);
}
```
