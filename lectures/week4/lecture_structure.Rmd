- What is a graph
- Directions and cycles
- Graph representation (Edge list, Adjacency list, Adjacency matrix)

## Part 2
- Euler path, Hamiltonian path
- Types of graphs
- Centrality (e.g. betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, node)

#Lecture 2

## Part 1

- Depth-first search

## Part 2
- Shortest path. Dijkstra algorithm.
- All-pairs shortest path.
- Recap of the material
